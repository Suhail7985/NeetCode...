<h3>Description</h3>
<p>There are <code>numBottles</code> water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange <code>numExchange</code> empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.</p>
<p>The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.</p>
<p>Given the two integers <code>numBottles</code> and <code>numExchange</code>, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.</p>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 13
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
</pre>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<strong>Input:</strong> numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> 19
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
